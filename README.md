  <b>Introduction</b>
</p>

This repository contains publications that I wrote for the PittPulse during my time as a Senior Computational Biology Correspondent. The PittPulse is the University of Pittsburgh's [premier health and science magazine](http://www.thepittpulse.org/mission/). Their purpose is to "provide a platform for individuals to explore and share a health, science, or medical topic that they are passionate about". It is composed of wonderful people who have helped me grow professionally by improving my writing and therefore my ability to express myself.

📜 `Computational Docking and BADock.pdf` 

This paper introduces the concepts of [Computational Docking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_(molecular)) to a broader audience since Computational Biology is my passion! After an introduction to the principles of docking which motivates the subsequent point, I introduced the audience to a new docking program that has MASSIVE potential. The software is known as [BADock](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29028891). Article was published March 2018. 

📜 `Computational Genomics Through the Lens of Dr. Miler Lee.pdf`

Publication of article based on interview I conducted with [Dr. Miler Lee](https://www.biology.pitt.edu/person/miler-lee) about the importance of Computational Genomics and advice he has for current undergraduates interested in that field. 

📜 `Miler Lee Interview Transcript.pdf`

Transcript of interview conducted for the publication mentioned above.
