  <b>Introduction</b>
</p>

This repository contains publications that I wrote for the PittPulse during my time as a Senior Computational Biology Correspondent. The PittPulse is the University of Pittsburgh's [premier health and science magazine](http://www.thepittpulse.org/mission/). Their purpose is to "provide a platform for individuals to explore and share a health, science, or medical topic that they are passionate about". It is composed of wonderful people who have helped me grow professionally by improving my writing and therefore my ability to express myself.
