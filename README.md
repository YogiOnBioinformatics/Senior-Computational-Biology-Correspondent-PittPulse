# Senior Computational Biology Correspondent for PittPulse

  <b>Introduction</b>
</p>

This repository contains publications that I wrote for the PittPulse during my time as a Senior Computational Biology Correspondent. The PittPulse is the University of Pittsburgh's [premier health and science magazine](http://www.thepittpulse.org/mission/). Their purpose is to "provide a platform for individuals to explore and share a health, science, or medical topic that they are passionate about". It is composed of wonderful people who have helped me grow professionally by improving my writing and therefore my ability to express myself.

ðŸ“œ `Computational Docking and BADock.pdf` 

This paper introduces the concepts of [Computational Docking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_(molecular)) to a broader audience since Computational Biology is my passion! After an introduction to the principles of docking which motivates the subsequent point, I introduced the audience to a new docking program that has MASSIVE potential. The software is known as [BADock](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29028891). Article was published March 2018.
